The long term vision of the documentation presented in this website is provide a template for Kubernetes installations that support users with highly variable skill sets and a excessive range of the workload size. Users may include people who have never written a program in their live as well as top-range researchers.

The system should provide the necessary aids and user interfaces to allow the writing of simple software without the need to install any local components. It should at the same time teach the basics of version control, automatic build and automatic testing as part of the daily work by the users. 

As users are getting more and more experienced in developing and designing software, learning programming languages and paradigms, the can peel back more and more of the layers of tooling and user interface.  In the end they will have access to the full range of functionality of the Kubernetes cluster.
