The long term vision of the documentation presented in this website is provide a template for Kubernetes installations that support users with highly variable skillsets and a excessive range of the workload size. Users may include people who have never written a programm in their live as well as top-range researchers.

The system should provide the necessary aids and user interfaces to allow the writing of simple software without the need to install any local components. It should at the same time teach the basics of version control, automatic build and automatic testing as part of the daily work by the users.
