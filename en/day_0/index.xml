      <description>Mission hypathia.net aims to provide a blueprint for operating a service to provide cloud based computing resources in a self-service manner. It presents an opinionated selection of components, configurations and practices tailored to environments that have a specific set of requirements, often found at academic institutions.
Assumed Requirements These are the main requirements that shaped the specific characteristics of hypathia.net:
 The organisation cannot use computing resources of a public cloud provider This may be due to procurement rules, legal obligations or the wish to run highly sensitive workloads in-house, rather than on hardware that the organization has virtually no control over.</description>

      <description>Infrastructure Environment You will need
 a network with Internet access as well as a sufficient number of available IP addresses. Be sure to allow for growth (even when successful beyond your wildest dreams!). Migrating the cluster from one network to another is possible, but not for the faint of heart. a DNS domain and a mechanism to integrate it with your super-domain (eg. compute-cloud.example.com). entries for all your users in an Directory System that allows access via LDAP.</description>

      <description>Currently the are a number of holes in the automation of the hypathia system. It should be possible to close them, with the construction of a number of operators and controllers for the kubernetes system. An overview can be seen in this graphic:  Kubernetes Tenant Ecosystem   OwnerListAdmissionController In order to use tools like Draft, users have to be able to list namespaces. But as granting this right would result in exposing the information about other users namespaces, this is not permitted in the current settings.</description>
