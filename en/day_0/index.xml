      <description>Infrastructure Environment You will need
 a network with Internet access as well as a sufficient number of available IP addresses. Be sure to allow for growth (even when successful beyond your wildest dreams!). Migrating the cluster from one network to another is possible, but not for the faint of heart. a DNS domain and a mechanism to integrate it with your super-domain (eg. compute-cloud.example.com). entries for all your users in an Directory System that allows access via LDAP.</description>

      <description>The long term vision of the documentation presented in this website is provide a template for Kubernetes installations that support users with highly variable skillsets and a excessive range of the workload size. Users may include people who have never written a programm in their live as well as top-range researchers.
The system should provide the necessary aids and user interfaces to allow the writing of simple software without the need to install any local components.</description>

      <description>Architecture Overview  Hypathia.net Architecture   A Hypatha.net cluster is constructured from the following main components:
 a Gitlab instance to hold the source and configuration data of the projects to be run on the cluster. It also acts as user interface for users to create projects and organize users into groups the actual Kubernetes cluster, running on a number of worker nodes. Each node also runs the pods neccesary to be the master node, but only one will be active at any time.</description>

      <description>Currently the are a number of holes in the automation of the hypathia system. It should be possible to close them, with the construction of a number of operators and controllers for the kubernetes system. An overview can be seen in this graphic:  Kubernetes Tenant Ecosystem   OwnerListAdmissionController In order to use tools like Draft, users have to be able to list namespaces. But as granting this right would result in exposing the information about other users namespaces, this is not permitted in the current settings.</description>
